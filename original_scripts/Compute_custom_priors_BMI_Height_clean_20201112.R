##' Compute Standard deviation prior (SD prior) for quantitative traits
##'  using pre-computed heritability.
##' 
##' \code{sd.prior.est} function will take the dataset as an input, a \eqn{h^2} 
##' value obtained from a public repository such as LDhub, 
##' (http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ldhub/), sample size and number of variants,
##' and will provide a sd.prior estimate that can be used to improve prediction
##' performance of RÃ¡pidoPGS functions on quantitative traits.
##' 
##' @param data a data.table containing the GWAS summary statistic input dataset. 
##' Must contain SNPID and SE columns.
##' @param h2 a numeric. Heritability estimate or h^2 (See details).
##' @param pi_i a numeric. Prior that a given variant is causal. DEFAULT = 1e-4.
